# Mosyle Bash Scripts

A collection of Bash scripts designed to automate macOS management tasks via Mosyle MDM. These scripts streamline system maintenance, enhance security, and improve user experience.

## ðŸ“œ Available Scripts

- **`Chrome - Cache & Cookies - FORCE`**  
  *Description:*  
  Forcefully clears Chrome cache and cookies for all user profiles without user confirmation. This script ensures that all cached data and cookies are removed, which can help resolve persistent browser issues.

- **`Chrome - Clear Cache & Cookies /w User Confirmation`**  
  *Description:*  
  Prompts the user for confirmation before clearing Chrome cache and cookies for all user profiles. This approach allows users to decide when to clear their data, preventing unexpected session terminations.
